## What is a dataset?

In data science, a dataset refers to a comprehensive compilation of data that is often organized into one or more database tables. In the case of tabular data, each table column represents a unique variable, while each row corresponds to a specific record within the dataset. Datasets are an essential component of many analytical and machine learning tasks, as they serve as the foundation for identifying patterns, making predictions, and generating insights.

## Accessing Lenstack's datasets

To access the datasets offered by Lenstack, users can subscribe to a plan that best fits their needs. Once subscribed, users can generate an API key with their subscription ID, which they can then use to seamlessly integrate the datasets with their applications. This integration allows for easy access to high-quality data, making it simple for users to leverage the power of data to drive business insights and decision-making.

## Subscribing to premium datasets

Accessing Lenstack's premium datasets requires the use of LST, an ERC-20 standard token developed on the Ethereum blockchain.
