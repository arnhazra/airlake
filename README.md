## What is a dataset?

In data science, a dataset refers to a comprehensive compilation of data that is often organized into one or more database tables. In the case of tabular data, each table column represents a unique variable, while each row corresponds to a specific record within the dataset. Datasets are an essential component of many analytical and machine learning tasks, as they serve as the foundation for identifying patterns, making predictions, and generating insights.
