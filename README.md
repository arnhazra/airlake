### Data marketplace

Data marketplaces have a strong relationship with metadata. A data marketplace offers data consumers an intuitive, secure, centralized, and standardized data shopping experience. It brings data closer to data analysts and scientists by utilizing the underlying metadata. It also tracks all your data products, which are often stored across a range of data domains.

### Subscribing Airlake's datasets

To access the datasets offered by Airlake, users can subscribe to a plan that best fits their needs. Once subscribed, users can generate an API key with their subscription ID, which they can then use to seamlessly integrate the datasets with their applications. This integration allows for easy access to high-quality data, making it simple for users to leverage the power of data to drive business insights and decision-making. Accessing Airlake's premium datasets requires the use of AFT, an ERC-20 standard token developed on the Ethereum blockchain. Users must hold AFT tokens in their cryptocurrency wallet in order to subscribe to the premium plans and unlock the full potential of the platform. This innovative use of blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent transactions, providing users with a seamless and trustworthy experience.
